## General Guidelines

- Be respectful and inclusive when interacting with fellow contributors and users. Refer to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more details.
- Always prioritize user privacy and data security in your code and contributions.

## Coding Style

### 1. Code Formatting

- Use a consistent code formatting style throughout the project. We recommend using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.
- Maintain proper indentation and consistent use of spaces or tabs as defined in the project configuration.

### 2. Naming Conventions

- Use meaningful and descriptive variable, function, and file names.
- Follow established naming conventions for your programming language (e.g., camelCase for JavaScript, snake_case for Python).

### 3. Comments

- Include comments in your code to explain complex logic, functions, or unusual code segments.
- Ensure that your comments are clear, concise, and up-to-date.

### 4. Code Organization

- Keep code files organized and adhere to the project's folder structure.
- Avoid excessive code duplication; favor reusable functions and modules.

## Documentation

### 1. Inline Documentation

- Document your code using inline comments, particularly for functions, classes, and complex logic.
- Ensure that documentation reflects the purpose, parameters, and return values of functions.

### 2. README Files

- Update and maintain the project's `README.md` with clear instructions for setting up, using, and contributing to the app.
- Include relevant badges, such as build status or version information.

## Commit Messages

- Write clear and informative commit messages that describe the purpose and context of each change.
- Use concise language and a consistent tense (present tense, imperative mood).

### Good Commit Examples:

- Add user authentication feature
- Implemented user registration and login functionality
- Added password hashing for user security
- Created user profile management endpoints
- Resolves #123

### Bad Commit Examples:

- Fixed some stuff
- Changes here and there
- Bug fixes and improvements

## Pull Requests

- Before submitting a pull request, ensure that your code adheres to the coding and documentation standards outlined in this style guide.
- Provide a clear and concise description of the changes in your pull request.
- Reference related issues or feature requests in your pull request, if applicable.

Thank you for following the Mind's Mom Style Guide. Your adherence to these guidelines contributes to a better, more efficient, and collaborative development process.
